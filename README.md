# vim-ftplugins

Vim ftplugins for various programming languages

## Why?

I've noticed a lot of open source programmers have duplicated content in their ftplugins directory. For example, the correct tab spacing for Ruby, Pyhton and C. This project aims to fix that by sharing these configurations.

By just adding `Plugin pmyjavec/vim-ftplugins` to your `.vimrc` you can now have correct tab and space settings for popular programming languages.
