# vim-ftplugins

Vim ftplugins for various programming languages

## Why?

I've noticed a lot of people have replicated content in their ftplugins directory, ie the correct tab spacing for Ruby, Pyhton and C.

This repository aims to reduce the overhead of that by sharing the ftplugin love so you can get starting programming in most languages without having to copy and paste yet another ftplugin file and just adding `Plugin pmyjavec/vim-ftplugins` to your `.vimrc`
